# Robot FrameworkÂ® Browser Extensions

Have you heard yet of the new Browser library? It's brings Playwright technology to my favorite testing tool: Robot Framework.

This will be a mono repository for extensions for Browser. Documentation will grow. 

If you have a working extension which you'd like to share with the community: feel free to make a PR!


Official documentation on how to extend Browser library with CommonJS can be found [in it's keyword documentation](https://marketsquare.github.io/robotframework-browser/Browser.html#Extending%20Browser%20library%20with%20a%20JavaScript%20module).
