# Robot FrameworkÂ® Browser Extensions

Have you heard yet of the new Browser library? It's brings Playwright technology to my favorite testing tool: Robot Framework.

This will be a mono repository for extensions for Browser. Documentation will grow. 

If you have a working extension which you'd like to share with the community: feel free to make a PR!
